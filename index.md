# Title: The Classical Classifier

## Description
In this project I will focus on training nueral networks to classify pieces of music by composer. To do this I will choose a group of composers, preferably a group from the same general time period but from many different regions and employing different artistic styles. I will then obtain professional recordings of their compositions and label each movement with the composers last name. I will train the nueral network on this data with the intention of exposing it later to the music of a more modern group of composers. For each modern composer, I will pass in recordings of their compositions into the nueral network and create a correlation map for each. I will then analyze these correlation maps to hopefully understand and identify the composers' musical ancestors or inspirations.

This analysis done with a nueral network will then be accompanied by qualitative research attempting to answer the same question: how does each modern composer relate to the group of older composers? Can this relationship be explained by home region, allegence to an artistic movement, focus on specific instruments or something else?

## Goals
- Choose an interesting and prolific group of composers (old and new)
- Obtain high quality performances of all or most of their compositions
- Successfully train a nueral network to classify the recordings by composer
- Conduct music history research to form a meaningful understanding of the context surrounding each older composer and their legacy
- Conduct music history research to understand each modern composer's influences
