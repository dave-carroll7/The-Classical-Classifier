# Title: The Classical Classifier

## Description
In this project I will focus on training nueral networks to classify pieces of music by composer. To do this a group of composers will be chosen, preferably a group from the same general time period but from many different regions and employing different artistic styles. Professional recordings of their compositions will be obtained and labeled with their last name. I will train the nueral network on this data with the intention of exposing it later to the music of a more modern group of composers. For each modern composer, their recordings will be passed into the nueral network and a correlation map will be generated. This correlation map will then be analyzed to hopefully understand and identify the composer's musical ancestors or inspirations.

This analysis done with a nueral network will then be accompanied by qualitative research attempting to answer the same question: how does each modern composer relate to the group of older composers? Can this relationship be explained by home region, allegence to an artistic movement, focus on specific instruments or something else?
